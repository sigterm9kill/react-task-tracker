##

This is a react to-do list SPA
Assuming you have GIT installed on your system,
In a terminal: $git clone https://github.com/sigterm9kill/react-task-tracker.git

## To run:
cd into the top directory
Open 2 terminal instances.
// Assuming that you have node installed
In the 1st Terminal: $npm run build 
                     $then npm start
2nd Terminal:        $npm run server

This is using json-server, which is a mock backend. This application is currently designed to be locally run only, not deployable in this state.

Thanks!
